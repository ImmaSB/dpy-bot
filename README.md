**Making my discord.py dank memer utility bot public after the original idea of bot got vanished for some reason.**


How to install/run the bot?

Run the following commands in your terminal: 
`git clone github.com/ImmaSB/dpy-bot`
`cd ImmaSB/dpy-bot`

Install all of the following modules before running the bot
1) discord `pip3 install discord`
2) discord-buttons-plugin `pip3 install discord_buttons_plugin`
3) requests `pip3 install requests`

Create a file named secret.py and store your bot token (which can be found at https://discord.com/developers) in a variable named **TOKEN**
For Example: TOKEN='4uyu98a3u09vt4o3iwhtiNgbwuoi4jvtlw'

Last but not the least, run the command `python3 main.py`
